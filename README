Simplistic EEPROM backup tool.  It beams the contents of the EEPROM from a
game card to a specified server and IP address.

In order to use, patch with the appropriate DLDI driver, install the
application, and create a config file in /data/settings/savsender.conf.  This
file must contain two lines, as follows:

<server_name>
<server_port>

The app will then send a raw byte stream to that server and port that
represents the contents of the EEPROM.  Use a tool like netcat to read the
data and dump it to a file.
